# audio-features-from-scratch

I will show how to extract the audio features from scratch in this repository instead of applying the ready-made library. Therefore, it is possible to understand how these features are extracted from a sound signal from the most fundamental mathematics.

The features including
1. Amplitude Envelope
2. Root Mean Square Energy
3. Magnitude Spectrum 
4. STFT (with Hann Window)
5. Spectrogram
6. Band Energy Ratio
7. Mel Spectrogram
8. MFCC
